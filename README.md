# Talaria
Next Generation Ethereum Based Messaging App  

Installation instructions are on http://www.arsent.ch/talaria  

How to build from source  

The local server runs on node.js  
If you want to directly run it :  
Just "node index.js", and "npm install" the possible missing packages (they should all be already in node_modules)  
If you want to make an executable :  
npm install -g pkg  
pkg index.js (that will generate an executable for Linux, Windows and MacOS)

Have fun !
